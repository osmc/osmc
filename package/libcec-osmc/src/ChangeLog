      switch and debug log spam for people without a TV connected
    * don't keep waiting for an updated power status from the TV for Panasonic,
      but request a status update once every 5 seconds, or we can possibly wait
      forever for the tv to send it
    * log what we received exactly when logging FIXME
    * typo in CVLCommandHandler::VendorPreActivateSourceHook. bugzid: 1087
    * if we failed to get the physical address of the device that we are

libcec (1.6.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * synced /debian directory with the one in precise (with a couple of changes)
  * changed/added:
    * serial port locking on linux
    * cec-client: added -m/--monitor startup options, which will start a
      monitor-only client. use 'mon 0' to switch to a normal client
    * display an alert message when the firmware of the adapter can be upgraded
    * added CEC 1.4 opcodes
    * send a feature abort again for all unhandled commands
    * refactored CLibCEC so a client registers itself within CCECProcessor,
      which then allocates one or more logical addresses for it.

  * interface changes:
    * added a new setting, bMonitorOnly, which will start a monitor-only client

  * fixed:
    * ensure that we don't crash out when trying to stop a thread that hasn't
      been started yet
    * don't send a 'disconnected' alert when the close method is called
    * use the correct source when transmitting an abort message as a reposonse
      to a vendor command with id
    * removed statics
    * check the client version, not the server version in
      libcec_configuration::operator==()
    * cec-config: fix physical address detection
    * LibCecSharp: fixed buffer overrun when copying libcec_configuration.
      fixes crash when trying to save the configuration in the config gui.

libcec (1.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * changed/added:
    * cec-client: show the firmware build date if available in cec-client -l
    * cec-client: don't activate the source when starting
    * cec-client: group up the output of the 'scan' command, and add the
      currently active source to the output
    * log the libCEC version in the 'connected to the CEC adapter' log entry,
      and add the firmware build date to the line if it's available, so all
      relevant version info is available in 1 log line.
    * async writes for CUSBCECAdapterCommunication. less locks and polls, more
      speed
    * added 'make docs' target, that updates the doxygen documentation

  * interface changes:
    * added operator == and != for libcec_configuration
    * added GetResponseOpcode(cec_opcode opcode) to cec_command
    * added the firmware build date to libcec_configuration, so it can be
      displayed by the client too.
    * added static CLibCEC::Alert() method and CEC_ALERT_CONNECTION_LOST value
    * added a callback to handle menu state changes. if the callback method
      returns 1, then the change is processed by the CCECBusDevice too. if 0,
      then the CCECBusDevice will always have menu state 'activated', so
      keypresses are routed. bugzid: 724
    * added a default menu language to libcec_configuration and set this
      language for devices controlled by libcec. bugzid: 69

  * fixed
    * CCECProcessor::IsActiveSource() - TV was never checked
    * don't call the deprecated SetActiveView() method in cec-client
    * request the active source if unknown in CCECProcessor::GetActiveSource()
    * don't try to match a device with PA 0xFFFF.
    * don't change the power status of a device when changing the stream path
    * don't set the power status to 'powered off' when marking the source
      managed by libcec as inactive, or the tv will might send a power control
      keycode when making it active again, potentially shutting down the system
    * potential segfault in CCECProcessor::GetDeviceByPhysicalAddress()
    * stream path changes when changed to the TV source (PA 0)
    * clear the unsupported features list in CCECBusDevice::ResetDeviceStatus()
    * never mark vendor commands as unsupported (only some may be unsupported),
      as well as some others that should never be marked unsupported
    * don't retry in CCECCommandHandler if the command has been marked as
      unsupported
    * don't request the PA of devices when handling an incoming CEC command, or
      it'll block things while waiting for a response. if that response never
      comes, or comes late, then other incoming commands will be timed out
      before they are handled
    * optimisation - strip unneeded virtual keywords from top level
      implementations
    * use the vlcommandhandler for the primary device that is handled by libCEC
      when a panasonic tv is detected, so delayed activate source commands are
      using the correct handler. bugzid: 723
    * set the power status of device controlled by libCEC to
      CEC_POWER_STATUS_ON
      instead of IN_TRANSITION_STANDBY_TO_ON. reset the device status of a
      device if it was detected as removed. bugzid: 755
    * potentially uninitialised values in cec_command
    * delay the 'active source' command for panasonic, until the vendor command
      that reports that the TV is powered on has been received. bugzid: 723
    * only respond to Give Physical Address with Report Physical Address.
      bugzid: 592
      This fixes several reports of the TV improperly switching to the libcec
      device after it has previously switched to another source. Fix confirmed
      with Panasonic and also reported to be an issue with Samsung and
      Philips.
    * check whether callback methods are set to a valid ptr
    * number of retries for polls
    * win32: fix build in paths with spaces. bugzid: 730
    * LibCecSharp: free the alert GC callback when cleaning up
    * the wrong setting was being read when powering on devices
    * close the connection when a comm error was detected, and notify the
      client via an alert
    * don't segfault when calling ThreadsWait() without a valid thread
    * lib/platform: fixed memleak
    * leak in CCECAdapterMessageQueue::Write
    * don't send commands if we know them to be unsupported. bugzid: 725

libcec (1.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixed:
    * fixed typo in CUSBCECAdapterCommands::RequestSettings() that prevented
      the settings from being read. the settings were still written, but never
      read when bGetSettingsFromROM = 1.

libcec (1.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * changed/added:
    * full firmware V2 support
    * -o/--osdname argument for cec-client to set a custom osd name
    * added the firmware version to cec-client's -l / --list-devices command.
      bugzid: 631
    * added power on command for Samsung AVR devices. bugzid: 361
    * added buttoncode for 'channels list' on Samsung (0x96)
    * don't check for the windows ddk when a prebuilt driver installer is
      present
    * respond to Get Menu Language. bugzid: 547. In the event that the menu
      language is undefined in libcec (currently the default), the response
      will be a feature abort.

  * interface changes:
    * added the firmware version to libcec_configuration (read-only). bumped
      server version to 1.6.0. fixed 'unknown server version' message on
      startup. bugzid: 631
    * added a new setting to control whether to put the TV in standby when the
      player is put in standby. added some missing bits (version numbers,
      config) to LibCecSharp. bugzid: 558
    * added an alert callback. bugzid: 462
    * added bShutdownOnStandby to libcec_configuration. bugzid: 660. This
      setting tells the client to shutdown when the TV switches off and is
      complimentary to bPowerOffOnStandby, which tells the PC to suspend.
      They are kept separate to maintain backwards compatability.

  * fixed
    * gcc 4.7 compilation
    * poll doesn't have an opcode. bugzid: 591
    * wait for MSGEND when data was received when opening the connection.
      bugzid: 536
    * mark the correct device as active source after a stream path change.
      if the new address is not found, but the old address is, then mark the
      old address as inactive. fixes TV switching back to the old active source
      when it scans for devices. bugzid: 592
    * ensure that the vendor ID is sent before trying to activate any SL device
      bugzid: 574
    * fixed possible crash when in CLibCEC::IsLibCECActiveSource() when libCEC
      doesn't know which device is the active source. bugzid: 479
    * correct handling CEC_USER_CONTROL_CODE_POWER. This ensures that the power
      code always operates as a toggle, depending on the current state, and
      that SetCurrentButton is always called for a valid user control code.
      bugzid: 570
    * frequency wasn't checked in GetTimeMs(), leading to incorrect wait times
      on some windows systems
    * refactored USB adapter communication. less locks, shorter locks, added
      documentation, lots of clean ups and no more incoming messages that are
      skipped
    * the destructor of CSerialSocket didn't call Close()
    * added guards in CSerialPort
    * reset m_socket to INVALID_SERIAL_SOCKET_VALUE after closing the
      connection
    * always wait for thread exit in CThread's desctructor
    * crash on exit after GetDeviceInformation()
    * check whether the destination is valid before setting anything in
      m_bWaitingForAck. fixes heap corruption and crash on exit. bugzid: 479
    * bUseTVMenuLanguage from libcec_configuration wasn't copied in
      SetConfiguration(), so this setting was reset to the default value
      (enabled) every time. bugzid: 617
    * request the vendor id of a device if needed when the device status is
      changed into 'present'. bugzid: 361
    * give priority to messages from the TV. removed the global lock in
      CCECProcessor when sending. this is no longer needed. bugzid: 238
    * add some bounds checking to the HDMI port number. bugzid: 508
    * fixed usbser.sys copying in the driver .INF. bugzid: 503
    * only update the physical address when it has actually changed. bugzid:
      672
    * moved the static variables in os-threads from the header to a separate
      cpp file, or it could lead to problems when included multiple times
    * don't send an active source command when the physical address couldn't be
      set, or it might confuse other CEC devices
    * serial socket timeouts. bugzid: 654
    * fixed possible crash when trying to request a vendor id of a device when
      the address of libCEC isn't known yet. bugzid: 654
    * extra guard so no commands are transmitted without a valid initiator.
      bugzid: 654
    * moved the timed ping to a separate thread. bugzid: 654
    * persist settings directly when they're changed, only persist settings
      that actually changed, only instruct the device to persist the settings
      in eeprom when something changed, and don't persist settings on exit.
      bugzid: 715
    * cec-config-gui: persist settings both in the eeprom and in the settings
      xml file
    * validate the input in CCECProcessor::IsActiveSource(). fixes potential
      crash when the active source isn't known. bugzid: 671

    * cec-config-gui: added support for the new 'send inactive source' setting

  * interface changes:
    * added an 'send inactive source' option to libcec_configuration, only
      supported by client/server 1.5.1 and up. bugzid: 439
    * added a command to the interface to start the bootloader directly,
      without going through all checks. bugzid: 218
    * LibCecSharp: implemented support for the new 'send inactive source'
      setting

  * fixed:
    * don't send an updated configuration when libCEC hasn't been initialised
      fully. bugzid: 459
    * don't send an updated configuration back when initialising. let the
      client call the GetCurrentConfiguration() method. bugzid: 459
    * configuration updates from libCEC. bugzid: 459
    * fixed accidental double deref. the method parameter already does that.

libcec (1.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * changed/added:
    * a new libcec_configuration structs, which allows the client app to pass
      a number of new options, like waking multiple devices on startup,
      overriding the vendor id, etc.
    * a new configuration GUI for Windows (.NET). this allows you to set
      libCEC's configuration for XBMC in a convenient GUI.
    * a CLI configuration tool (unfinished) for other platforms. will be
      finished in an update.
    * implemented power up for LG devices other than a TV
    * win32: don't install libcec to the system directory by default, and
      delete previous (testing) copies if present
    * wait for multiple responses, not just for one at a time
    * set the ackmask to 0 when closing the connection
    * don't send 'image view on' when calling SetActiveSource()
    * don't send power on, acitve source and standby commands by default in
      cec-client
    * platform: added CTryLockObject
    * platform: added an Init() method in CTimeout, so it can be reset

  * interface changes:
    * added a new initialiser method: CecInitialise()/cec_initialise(), that
      accepts a "libc_configuration" struct as parameter. this way, the
      signature of the init method can stay the same when adding new options.
      in LibCecSharp, the new method appears as a new constructor.
    * added CanPersistConfiguration()/cec_can_persist_configuration()
    * added PersistConfiguration()/cec_persist_configuration()
    * added GetCurrentConfiguration()/cec_get_current_configuration()
    * added SetConfiguration()/cec_set_configuration()
    * added GetLogicalAddresses()/cec_get_logical_addresses(): returns the list
      of addresses controlled by libCEC
    * added RescanDevices()/cec_rescan_devices(): lets libCEC force polls to
      all logical addresses.
    * added a callback that is called when libCEC's configuration changed.
    * moved the autodetect address api call to libcec_configuration. only send
      power up commands to non-tv devices when the power state is not
      on/transition->on. let players call the power up/power down command.
    * return the anynet return keycode directly instead of translating it to
      'return' for v1.5.0+ clients
    * extracted CecSharpTypes.h in LibCecSharp. LibCecSharp is now in the
      CecSharp namespace
    * include the local cectypes.h in cec.h and cecc.h instead of system wide
    * deprecated GetLibVersion() methods. use libcec_configuration instead
    * removed deprecated CECCreate() method
    
  * fixed:
    * fixed a lot of LG specific issues
    * fixed OS-X compilation. credits: Dustin Cooper
    * fixed a couple of possible deadlocks, e.g. when closing the connection
      while receiving data
    * cleaned up existing code
    * libCEC no longer puts incoming data in a fifo buffer, but tries to
      process it directly, which fixes issues like libCEC blocking processing
      new commands while waiting for transmission acks.
    * 'unsupported command' marking in CCECBusDevice
    * ensure that the ackmask is always set to 0 when closing the connection
      and that the call doesn't block the Close() call
    * don't try to read or write in CUSBCECAdapterCommunication when the
      connection has been closed
    * LibCecSharp: added quotes to the linker statement for libcec.lib. fixes
      compilation in paths with spaces. closes #20
    * LibCecSharp: set the callback methods in libcec to NULL before closing
      the connection, since these might already have been destroyed in .NET
    * LibCecSharp: delete the internal callback struct when closing the
      connection
    * LibCecSharp: pass correctly formatted logical address lists
    * ensure that the vendor id is requested first when requesting info from a
      device, so we are using the correct handler
    * keep the 'busy state' of the command handler in CCECBusDevice
    * poll the next device when the current is handled by libCEC.
    * check the vendor id of a device before sending a power on command
    * ensure that there always is at least one device type set
    * transmit a keypress and key release as power on command when the target
      device isn't the TV
    * don't do a full reinit when not needed
    * fix active source switches for the standard CEC implementation
    * ensure that we don't send data to ourself
    * check whether the port is open, not whether libCEC is initialised in
      Transmit()
    * platform: fixed return value from CCondition::Wait()
    * platform: don't broadcast but wake one thread in
      CProtectedSocket::MarkReady()
    * platform: include stdint.h in windows/os-types.h instead of typedef'ing
      ints
    * platform: fixed tcp socket error handling and return value.
    * platform: fixed return values of socket operations in lib/platform
    * platform: added predicate in CCondition

   * interface changes:
     * added optional callback methods to libCEC. enable them by calling
       EnableCallbacks(ICECCallbacks *callbacks) /
       cec_enable_callbacks(ICECCallbacks *callbacks). after this method is
       called, the GetNext...() methods will not return any data

   * fixed:
     * don't send the power up/down keypress to listeners when in the initial
       device state (powered off). fixes unexpected shutdown in XBMC when

libcec (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * changed/added:
    * make libudev optional. if libudev is not available on linux, adapter
      autodetection will also not be available. fixes compilation on Hardy/ATV1
    * added a C++ CLR wrapper for libCEC, so libCEC can be used by any .NET
      language
    * added vendor support for LG
    * added vendor support for Philips
    * added vendor support for Yamaha
    * added vendor support for Onkyo
    * added 'scan' command to cec-client, that displays info about devices on
      the bus. made all ToString() methods available on the interface.
    * added '-s' or '--single-command' to cec-client. starting cec-client with
      this parameter executes a single command in cec-client and does not power
      on devices on startup and power them off on exit. this way, you can use
      cec-client in a shell script. since there's some handshaking involved at
      startup, this is not very fast. to execute a command and only display the
      result and any error/warning, execute it with
      RESULT=`echo command | cec-client -s -d 3` (on linux/osx, win32 batch
      files are a bit different)
    * added HDMI port ('-p' or '--port') and base device ('-b' or '--base') to
      cec-client's parameters

    * added GetDeviceOSDName()/cec_get_osd_name()
    * added SendKeypress()/cec_send_keypress() and SendKeyRelease()/
      cec_send_key_release()
    * added VolumeUp()/cec_volume_up(), VolumeDown()/cec_volume_down(),
      MuteAudio()/cec_mute_audio()
    * added GetActiveDevices()/cec_get_active_devices(), IsActiveDevice()/
      cec_is_active_device(), IsActiveDeviceType()/cec_is_active_device_type().
    * added SetHDMIPort()/cec_set_hdmi_port(). devices are now detected on load
      and when a device with the same physical address is detected, libcec will
      use the selected hdmi port on that device. should fix source selection on
      other devices, like an amplifier
    * added a hook in libcec for physical address autodetection
  * fixed:
    * don't request the physical address from the tv (it's always 0x0000)
    * set the proper ackmask before doing anything else
    * don't unlock the transmit mutex in CCECProcessor while waiting for an
      answer
    * fix device polling
    * refactor CEC read/write. keep a single lock for all writes, not one per
      device
    * ignore other data while waiting for a response
    * retry failed tranmissions
    * don't delete a message before it's been sent when starting the bootloader
    * or when sending a ping
    * fixed possible segfault when switching the command handler after a vendor
    * id changed
    * handle audio opcodes correctly
    * inactive source should be directly addressed at the TV
    * don't report a changed physical address when it hasn't changed
    * routing information sets the stream path, not the physical address
    * don't scan the whole bus in CCECProcessor::IsActiveDeviceType()
    * don't request the vendor id from devices that are handled by libcec
    * mark device status as present when a command was received from a device
    * always send a power on command in CCECBusDevice::PowerOn()
    * don't request updates statusses unless needed
    * report physical address sends 3 parameters, not 2. check whether the
      device type is correct
    * devices can send vendor commands from other vendors, so don't assume the
      device is of a certain vendor when it sends commands with a vendor id
    * thread safety fixes. bugzid: 19
    * clear any previous input when opening a connection to the adapter.
      bugzid: 54
    * use the correct source address in CSLCommandHandler::HandleVendorCommand()
    * uncorrected CEC_OPCODE_DEVICE_VENDOR_ID. closes #5
    * renamed enum methods. fixes potential macro collision with isset().
