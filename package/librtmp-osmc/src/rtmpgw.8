.B rtmpgw \-h
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rtmpgw
is a server for streaming media content from RTMP out to HTTP.
.LP
.B rtmpgw
listens for HTTP requests that specify RTMP stream parameters and
then returns the RTMP data in the HTTP response. The only valid
HTTP request is "GET /" but additional options can be provided
in URL-encoded fashion. Options specified on the command line will
be used as defaults, which can be overridden by options in the HTTP
request.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "Network Parameters"
These options define how to connect to the media server.
.TP
\fB\-\-rtmp		\-r\fP\ \fIurl\fP
URL of the server and media content.
.TP
\fB\-\-host		\-n\fP\ \fIhostname\fP
Overrides the hostname in the RTMP URL.
.TP
\fB\-\-port		\-c\fP\ \fIport\fP
Overrides the port number in the RTMP URL.
.TP
\fB\-\-protocol	\-l\fP\ \fInumber\fP
Overrides the protocol in the RTMP URL.
.nf
  0 = rtmp
  1 = rtmpt
  2 = rtmpe
  3 = rtmpte
  4 = rtmps
  5 = rtmpts
.fi
.TP
\fB\-\-socks		\-S\fP\ \fIhost:port\fP
Use the specified SOCKS4 proxy.
.SS "Connection Parameters"
These options define the content of the RTMP Connect request packet.
If correct values are not provided, the media server will reject the
connection attempt.
.TP
\fB\-\-app		\-a\fP\ \fIapp\fP
Name of application to connect to on the RTMP server. Overrides
the app in the RTMP URL. Sometimes the rtmpdump URL parser cannot
determine the app name automatically, so it must be given explicitly
using this option.
.TP
\fB\-\-tcUrl		\-t\fP\ \fIurl\fP
URL of the target stream. Defaults to rtmp[e]://host[:port]/app/playpath.
.TP
\fB\-\-pageUrl		\-p\fP\ \fIurl\fP
URL of the web page in which the media was embedded. By default no
value will be sent.
.TP
\fB\-\-swfUrl		\-s\fP\ \fIurl\fP
URL of the SWF player for the media. By default no value will be sent.
.TP
\fB\-\-flashVer	\-f\fP\ \fIversion\fP
Version of the Flash plugin used to run the SWF player. The
default is "LNX 10,0,32,18".
.TP
\fB\-\-auth		\-u\fP\ \fIstring\fP
An authentication string to be appended to the Connect message. Using
this option will append a Boolean TRUE and then the specified string.
This option is only used by some particular servers and is
deprecated. The more general
.B \-\-conn
option should be used instead.
.TP
\fB\-\-conn		\-C\fP\ \fItype:data\fP
Append arbitrary AMF data to the Connect message. The type
must be B for Boolean, N for number, S for string, O for object, or Z
for null. For Booleans the data must be either 0 or 1 for FALSE or TRUE,
respectively. Likewise for Objects the data must be 0 or 1 to end or
begin an object, respectively. Data items in subobjects may be named, by
prefixing the type with 'N' and specifying the name before the value, e.g.
NB:myFlag:1. This option may be used multiple times to construct arbitrary
AMF sequences. E.g.
.nf
  \-C B:1 \-C S:authMe \-C O:1 \-C NN:code:1.23 \-C NS:flag:ok \-C O:0
.fi
.SS "Session Parameters"
These options take effect after the Connect request has succeeded.
.TP
\fB\-\-playpath	\-y\fP\ \fIpath\fP
Overrides the playpath parsed from the RTMP URL. Sometimes the
rtmpdump URL parser cannot determine the correct playpath
automatically, so it must be given explicitly using this option.
.TP
.B \-\-live		\-v
Specify that the media is a live stream. No resuming or seeking in
live streams is possible.
.TP
\fB\-\-subscribe	\-d\fP\ \fIstream\fP
Name of live stream to subscribe to. Defaults to
.IR playpath .
.TP
\fB\-\-start		\-A\fP\ \fInum\fP
Start at
.I num
seconds into the stream. Not valid for live streams.
.TP
\fB\-\-stop		\-B\fP\ \fInum\fP
Stop at
.I num
seconds into the stream.
.TP
\fB\-\-buffer		\-b\fP\ \fInum\fP
Set buffer time to
.I num
milliseconds. The default is 20000.
.TP
\fB\-\-timeout		\-m\fP\ \fInum\fP
Timeout the session after
.I num
seconds without receiving any data from the server. The default is 120.
.SS "Security Parameters"
These options handle additional authentication requests from the server.
.TP
\fB\-\-token		\-T\fP\ \fIkey\fP
Key for SecureToken response, used if the server requires SecureToken
authentication.
.TP
\fB\-\-jtv		\-j\fP\ \fIJSON\fP
JSON token used by legacy Justin.tv servers. Invokes NetStream.Authenticate.UsherToken
.TP
\fB\-\-swfhash		\-w\fP\ \fIhexstring\fP
SHA256 hash of the decompressed SWF file. This option may be needed if
the server uses SWF Verification, but see the
.B \-\-swfVfy
option below. The hash is 32 bytes, and must be
given in hexadecimal. The
.B \-\-swfsize
option must always be used with this option.
.TP
\fB\-\-swfsize		\-x\fP\ \fInum\fP
Size of the decompressed SWF file. This option may be needed if the
server uses SWF Verification, but see the
.B \-\-swfVfy
option below. The
.B \-\-swfhash
option must always be used with this option.
.TP
\fB\-\-swfVfy		\-W\fP\ \fIurl\fP
URL of the SWF player for this media. This option replaces all three
of the
.BR \-\-swfUrl ,
.BR \-\-swfhash ,
and
.B \-\-swfsize
options. When this option is used, the SWF player is retrieved from the
specified URL and the hash and size are computed automatically. Also
the information is cached in a
.I .swfinfo
file in the user's home directory, so that it doesn't need to be retrieved
and recalculated every time rtmpdump is run. The .swfinfo file records
the URL, the time it was fetched, the modification timestamp of the SWF
file, its size, and its hash. By default, the cached info will be used
for 30 days before re-checking.
.TP
\fB\-\-swfAge		\-X\fP\ \fIdays\fP
Specify how many days to use the cached SWF info before re-checking. Use
0 to always check the SWF URL. Note that if the check shows that the
SWF file has the same modification timestamp as before, it will not be
retrieved again.
.SS Miscellaneous
.TP
\fB\-\-device		\-D\fP\ \fIaddress\fP
Listener IP address. The default is 0.0.0.0, i.e., any IP address.
.TP
\fB\-\-sport		\-g\fP\ \fIport\fP
Listener port. The default is 80.
.TP
.B \-\-quiet		\-q
Suppress all command output.
.TP
.B \-\-verbose		\-V
Verbose command output.
.TP
.B \-\-debug		\-z
Debug level output. Extremely verbose, including hex dumps of all packet data.
.TP
.B \-\-help		\-h
Print a summary of command options.
.SH EXAMPLES
The HTTP request
.nf
	GET /?r=rtmp:%2f%2fserver%2fmyapp&y=somefile HTTP/1.0
.fi
is equivalent to the
.BR rtrmpdump (1)
invocation
.nf
	rtmpdump \-r rtmp://server/myapp \-y somefile
.fi

Note that only the shortform (single letter) options are supported.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B HOME
The value of
.RB $ HOME
is used as the location for the
.I .swfinfo
file.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I $HOME/.swfinfo
Cache of SWF Verification information
