-[B]Kodi Privacy Policy[/B]
-[I]2016 Oct 23[/I]
-
-Your privacy is an important factor that the XBMC Foundation and Team Kodi considers in the development of all of our software and services. We are committed to being transparent and open. This Privacy Policy explains generally how we receive information about you, and what we do with that information once we have it.
-
-
-[B]What do we mean by “personal information?”[/B]
-
-For us, “personal information” means information which identifies you, like your name or email address.
-
-Any information that falls outside of this is “non-personal information.”
-
-If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information. If we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.
-
-
-[B]How do we learn information about you?[/B]
-
-We learn information about you when:
-
-    • you give it to us directly (e.g., when you choose to send us logs in the forums);
-    • we collect it automatically through our software and services (e.g., when your Kodi connects with our servers to update add-ons, or in download statistics provided by Google Play);
-    • when we try and understand more about you based on information you’ve given to us (e.g., when we use your platform information provided to the add-on server to figure out which platforms use Kodi the most, to better understand where we should focus our efforts).
-
-
-[B]What do we do with your information once we have it?[/B]
-
-Generally, we use your information to help us provide and improve our software and services for you (e.g., we use a log you send us to figure out why Kodi isn’t playing a video right or why it might have crashed, or we determine how many active users are using each platform in order to determine how to allocate resources per platform).
-
-
-[B]When do we share your information with others?[/B]
-
-    • When we have asked and received your permission to share it.
-    • When we are fulfilling our educational purpose. We sometimes publicly release information to make our software better and foster an open web, but when we do so, we will remove your personal information and try to disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of you being re-identified. For example, in a blog post we might attempt to analyze from available data how many active users of Kodi existed at the time and share that info with the community.
-    • When the law requires it. To date, this has never happened, and we do not anticipate it happening in the future, as the majority of the information we collect is already almost entirely anonymous and never shows unique user behavior, except in voluntarily submitted logs on our forum.
-    • If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your information to a successor or affiliate.
-
-
-[B]How do we store and protect your personal information?[/B]
-
-We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it. We implement physical, business and technical security measures. Despite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we’ll notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
-
-We also don’t want your personal information for any longer than we need it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for. Once we don’t need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it longer. In the case of logs provided to us in the forums, our servers do not store those logs, and we rely on the users submitting those logs to remove the links when they deem appropriate.
-
-
-[B]What else should you know?[/B]
-
-We’re a global organization and our computers are in several different places around the world. We also use service providers whose computers may also be in various countries. This means that your information might end up on one of those computers in another country, and that country may have a different level of data protection regulation than yours. By giving us information, you consent to this kind of transfer of your information. No matter what country your information is in, we comply with applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we make in this privacy policy.
-
-If you are under 13, we don’t want your personal information, and you must not provide it to us. If you are a parent and believe that your child who is under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us to have your child’s information removed.
-
-
-[B]What if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices?[/B]
-
-We may need to change this policy and our notices. The updates will be posted online. If the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through Kodi’s usual channels for such announcements such as blog posts and forums. Your continued use of the product or service after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes. To make your review more convenient, we will post an effective date at the top of the page.

+[B]OSMC Privacy Policy[/B]
+[I]2017 Feb 3[/I]
+
+Your privacy is an important factor to OSMC. We are committed to being transparent and open. This Privacy Policy explains generally how we receive information about you, and what we do with that information once we have it.
+
+[B]What information do we collect?[/B]
+We collect information from you when you register on our site and gather data if you participate our forum by reading, writing, and evaluating the content shared here.
+
+When registering on our site, you may be asked to enter your name and e-mail address. You may, however, visit our site without registering. Your e-mail address will be verified by an email containing a unique link. If that link is visited, we know that you control the e-mail address.
+
+When registered and posting, we record the IP address that the post originated from. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.
+
+We collect information automatically through our software and services, such as when your device connects to our server to download updates.
+
+[B]What do we use your information for[/B]
+Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:
+
+	To personalize your experience —  your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs.
+	To improve our site — we continually strive to improve our site offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you.
+	To improve customer service — your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs.
+	To send periodic emails — the email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications that you request about changes to topics or in response to your user name, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.
+
+[B]How do we protect your information[/B]
+We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information.
+
+[B]Data retention policy[/B]
+We will make a good faith effort to:
+
+	Retain server logs containing the IP address of all requests to this server no more than 90 days.
+	Retain the IP addresses associated with registered users and their posts no more than 5 years.
+
+[B]Third party disclosure[/B]
+We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
+
+
+[B]What if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices?[/B]
+We may need to change this policy and our notices. Your continued use of the product or service after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes. To make your review more convenient, we will post an effective date at the top of the page.
