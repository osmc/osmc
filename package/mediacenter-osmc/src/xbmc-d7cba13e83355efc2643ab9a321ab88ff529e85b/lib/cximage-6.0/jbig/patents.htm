<H1>JBIG1 patent information</H1>

<P>by Markus Kuhn

<P>For many years, the doubts about the patent situation have
prevented the JBIG1 standard from becoming widely used on the
Internet (e.g., not a single web browser has support for it
integrated). As the author of a <A
HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/jbigkit/">freely available JBIG1
implementation</A>, I'm investigating the current patent license
requirements for the JBIG1 standard, and this page summarizes what I
have found out so far.

<H2>Patent list</H2>

<P><A HREF="JBIG-patents.pdf">Annex E</A> of the JBIG1 standard (<A
HREF="http://www.itu.int/rec/recommendation.asp?type=folders&amp;paren
t=T-REC-T.82">ITU-T Recommendation T.82(1993)</A> and <A

BER=19498&amp;ICS1=35&amp;ICS2=40&amp;ICS3=">International Standard
ISO/IEC 1154 4:1993</A>), lists the following patents and says that a
license for these might be required to implement the standard:</P>

<P>The owners of the above patents have filed with the ISO and ITU a
statement of willingness to grant a license under these rights on
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions to applications
desiring to obtain such a license. These statements are recorded in
the <A HREF="http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/dbase/patent/">ITU Patents
Database</A>.

<P>JBIG-KIT comes without any patent licence. I do not know for sure,
which patents still affect which use of JBIG in which country (most of
the ones listed have already expired anyway). The most important
patents are the ones owned by IBM on the QM coder. Some of the other
patents can be avoided by disabling progressive coding. In some
countries, non-commercial and research use of patented ideas does not
require a license anyway.

<P>Information received from these so far:

<UL>

<LI>2000-08-01: All the JBIG1 related AT&amp;T patents are now owned
by Lucent Technologies and can be licensed for a lump sum of 15000
USD. For more information and a patent license agreement, contact
Larry Greenberg (greenberg at lucent.com), Jim Finnegan, or Peter
Crefeld (pcrefeld at lucent.com) at Lucent. They told me that they
have made a general commitment to Standards Bodies that they will be
non-discriminatory in this licensing, therefore they can't offer a
free license for non-commercial implementations or applications.

<H2>JBIG2 license waiver</H2>

<P>I recently read with great interest in Annex I of the final draft
for <A HREF="http://www.jpeg.org/jbigpt2.html">JBIG2</A> (ISO/IEC FCD
14492, <A
HREF="http://www.itu.int/rec/recommendation.asp?type=folders&amp;lang=e&amp;parent=T-REC-T.88">ITU-T
T.88</A>) that IBM has agreed to license the arithmetic encoding
patents free of charge to JBIG2 implementors. Apparently, the IBM IPR
statement provided for JPEG2000 (ISO/IEC 15444 and ITU-T T.800) and
JBIG2 allowed no-royalty use of the patents on a certain list for "any
WG1 standard", which refers to the ISO/IEC working group that
comprises both JBIG and JPEG. It's possible that this means that IBM
will allow royalty-free use of the patents on that list for JBIG1 as
well, but I don't know yet whether that has been the intention or
effect.

<P>I hope that this waiver therefore can also be applied to JBIG1
implementations, as I would love to be able to add to the
documentation of my package a statement saying that its use will not
require a patent license (or at least not for the non-progressive
modes). I am still struggling to find a competent source to confirm
that this is indeed the case.

<P>Thanks to Sebestyen Istvan and William Rucklidge from the JPEG/JBIG
committee (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 1 and ITU-T SG8) for helpful
information.
