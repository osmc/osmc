libmng 1.0.10
-------------

Added provisional ANG and anIM support, and made some minor bugfixes.

libmng 1.0.9
------------

A number of optimizations in the chunk handling and reader/writer code.
This saves over 20KB on binary footprint!

Also several bugfixes and a couple of patches bring it another step
closer to perfection.... :-)

See CHANGELOG for details.
