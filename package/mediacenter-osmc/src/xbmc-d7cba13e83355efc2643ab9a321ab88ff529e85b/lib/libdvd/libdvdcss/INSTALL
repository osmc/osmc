INSTALL file for libdvdcss, a DVD access library


Configuring libdvdcss
=====================

A typical way to configure libdvdcss is:

   ./configure --prefix=/usr

See `./configure --help' for more information.


If you got libdvdcss from its version control system, please bootstrap first:

   autoreconf -i


Building libdvdcss
==================

Once configured, run `make' to build libdvdcss.

If you have player keys, you need to put them in the file csskeys.h, before
configuring libdvdcss to enable the "key" method (the one from libcss).


Installing libdvdcss
====================

You can install libdvdcss by typing:

   make install


Building libdvdcss for Win32
============================

You have two alternatives to build libdvdcss for Win32:

- on Linux, using the mingw.org or mingw-w64 cross-compilers.

 If you are running Debian, there is are mingw32 packages you can use.

 If you are cross-compiling from the Debian package, you can use the following
 commands, for example:

  ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --target=i586-mingw32msvc \
  --build=i386-linux

  make

- natively on Windows, using MSYS + MinGW (www.mingw.org):

 (MSYS is a minimal build environment to compile unixish projects under
  Windows. It provides all the common Unix tools like sh, gmake...)

 You will need to download and install the latest MSYS and MINGW.

 To build libdvdcss you just have to run the following commands:
  ./configure
  make
