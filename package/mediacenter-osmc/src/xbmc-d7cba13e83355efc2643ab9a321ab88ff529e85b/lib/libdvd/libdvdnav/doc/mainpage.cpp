\mainpage The libdvdnav Reference Documentation

\section intro Introduction

This reference is not maintained. See the README file for pointers on
current documentation.

This reference documentation is intended to both provide a comprehensive reference to
the <tt>libdvdnav</tt> DVD navigation library and a brief introduction to the library
for new users.

This documentation is automatically generated from the <tt>libdvdnav</tt> code so
should remain somewhat relevant but as always be wary that <tt>libdvdnav</tt>
is currently in heavy development and the API is not yet frozen.

\subsection feedback Feedback

All comments, error reports, additional information and criticism of all sorts
should be directed to <tt>dvd-devel@lists.sf.net</tt>.
