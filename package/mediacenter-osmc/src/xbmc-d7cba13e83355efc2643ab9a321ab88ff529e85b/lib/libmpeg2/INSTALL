Unix build instructions
-----------------------

./configure
make
make install

If you install from Subversion you'll have to run ./bootstrap first


Building for win32
------------------

There are at least three ways to do it:

- natively on Windows using Microsoft VC++ and the vc++ project
  included in this distribution.

- natively on Windows using MSYS + MINGW (www.mingw.org) (MSYS is a
  minimal build environnement to compile unixish projects under
  windows. It provides all the common unix tools like sh, gmake...)

- or on Linux, using the mingw32 cross-compiler


Building using MSYS + MINGW on windows
--------------------------------------

First you will need to download and install the latest MSYS (version
1.0.7 as of now) and MINGW. The installation is really easy. Begin
with the MSYS auto-installer and once this is done, extract MINGW into
c:\msys\1.0\mingw. You also have to remember to remove the make
utility included with MINGW as it conflicts with the one from MSYS
(just rename or remove c:\msys\1.0\mingw\bin\make.exe).

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.7-i686-2002.04.24-1.exe
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MinGW-1.1.tar.gz

Then you can build the package using:
# ./configure
# make


Building using the mingw32 cross-compiler
-----------------------------------------

You need to install mingw32 first. For Debian GNU/Linux users, there
is a mingw32 package. Otherwise you might get it from the mingw site
at http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml.

The videolan project also keeps precompiled mingw32 binaries at
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/windows.html . If you install these,
you'll have to set your PATH accordingly to include
/usr/local/cross-tools/bin too.

The build should then proceed using something like:
# CC=i586-mingw32msvc-gcc ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc
# make
