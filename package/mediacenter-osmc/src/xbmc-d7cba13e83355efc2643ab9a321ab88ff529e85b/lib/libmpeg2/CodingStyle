These are the formatting rules for mpeg2dec code. Please try to follow
these for any new contributions:

* Code should not be wider than 79 columns.

* A tab character should be displayed as 8 columns wide.

* Indentations are 4 columns wide.

* Braces are never alone on a line, instead they are on the same line
  as their associated control flow (if/then/else/while/for)
  statement. Functions are a special case, their opening and ending
  braces are alone on their own line, in the leftmost column. This is
  all standard K&R coding style.

* Braces are optional. It's ok to skip them if there is only one
  statement in the block you'd put the braces around.

* There is always a space separating the function name and the
  associated argument list i.e. f ()

* There is always a space separating an if/while/for control flow
  statement and the associated conditions i.e. if (x)

* Function argument lists are of the form f (a, b, c) i.e. there is
  always a space between the arguments.

* Pointers are declared with spaces both before and after the star.

* There are no parenthesis around a return expression i.e. return x;

* Non-static functions have names of the form mpeg2_*

Here is a short example for reference:

static int foo (int bar, int baz, int * quux)
{
    if (bar == baz)
	return *quux;
    else do {
	bar += *quux;
	quux++;
    } while (bar != baz);
    return *quux + bar;
}

* For xemacs users, this is what I use:

(defconst mpeg2-c-style '("gnu"
                         (c-basic-offset . 4)
                         (c-label-minimum-indentation . 0)
                         (c-offsets-alist . (
                                             (knr-argdecl-intro . +)
                                             (topmost-intro-cont . +)
                                             ))
                         ))
(c-add-style "mpeg2" mpeg2-c-style)

Then to use that coding style, type M-x c-set-style mpeg2

* For emacs users, the following should work:

(defun mpeg2-c-mode ()
  "C mode with adjusted defaults for use with mpeg2dec."
  (interactive)
  (c-mode)
  (c-set-style "gnu")
  (setq c-basic-offset 4))

Then to use that coding style, type M-x mpeg2-c-mode

* For vim users, the following might help:

set noexpandtab
set tabstop=8
set shiftwidth=4
