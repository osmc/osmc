Please do use these tests if you do some libmpeg2 changes.

* get the official suite of mpeg2 torture tests at
http://libmpeg2.sourceforge.net/files/mpeg2dec-streams.tar.gz

or using SVN :

# svn co svn://svn.videolan.org/libmpeg2/streams

(OK, I did some reorganization work on the archive, so it is not really the
official suite anymore)

Then,

* extract this archive at the same level as your mpeg2dec directory :
  in your working directory you should have subdirectories mpeg2dec
  and streams.

* or, extract this archive where you want, but change the first line
  of the "tests" file to reflect that location. Do _not_ remove the
  pound (#) sign at the beginning of the line.

Now run test/regression <test> <idct>

<test> is the name of the test suite you want to use. For the official
mpeg video conformance tests, just use "tests".

<idct> is the type of IDCT you are using. If your machine supports MMX,
choose "mmx". If your machine uses the c idct, choose "c"

That's it...
