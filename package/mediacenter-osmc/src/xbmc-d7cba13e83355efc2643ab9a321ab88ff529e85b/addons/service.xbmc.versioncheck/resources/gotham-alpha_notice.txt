[B]Call to Gotham alpha users[/B]

In the last blog post which you can read at http://xbmc.org we already told you we are working hard towards a Beta release. There are still some things that need to be improved before we are confident on releasing a Beta. We will of course keep you posted when that time comes. Work continues by the developers to iron out the know remaining issues as much as possible. Thanks to the users who install our latest development builds, the remaining problems become known and we try to address these. Do note we may not be able to address all issues reported, as time and available developers are limited. We all try our best but we hope all of you will understand this and we need to accept that some issues will remain.
If you are a developer and you are confident enough to dive into our source code and fix it, we would appreciate it very much if you would create a so called pull-request on our github page for code review so it might be included.

As it stands now it’s highly unlikely there will be another monthly release before Beta release as there isn’t a merge window any more like we had in the previous months. The monthly builds were done at the end of the month to mark the most stable Gotham version. However now we only do bug fixing, each build we create daily should become better and better. This also means you can download and install the most recent nightly build quite safely to have the most up to date version running. Because of this we would like to ask if possible to upgrade to the last available “nightly build” (the links can be found at the end). As I just mentioned these builds should be considered more stable than any previous monthly Gotham release. There should be no reason to keep using any older monthly build. This would also help to identify any remaining issues left and helps us make the upcoming Gotham release a great one.
