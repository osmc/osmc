 * DVDNAV_NAV_PACKET
 *
 * NAV packets are useful for various purposes. They define the button
 * highlight areas and VM commands of DVD menus, so they should in any
 * case be sent to the SPU decoder/overlaying engine for the menus to work.
 * NAV packets also provide a way to detect PTS discontinuities, because
 * they carry the start and end PTS values for the current VOBU.
 * (pci.vobu_s_ptm and pci.vobu_e_ptm) Whenever the start PTS of the
 * current NAV does not match the end PTS of the previous NAV, a PTS
 * discontinuity has occured.
 * NAV packets can also be used for time display, because they are
 * timestamped relatively to the current Cell.

 * highlight a different button. Please note, that at the moment only mode 1
 * highlights are reported this way. That means, when the button highlight
 * has been moved around by some function call, you will receive an event
 * telling you the new button. But when a button gets activated, you have
 * to handle the mode 2 highlighting (that is some different colour the
 * button turns to on activation) in your application.

 * DVDNAV_WAIT

 * Such applications should wait until their fifos are empty
 * when they receive this type of event.
