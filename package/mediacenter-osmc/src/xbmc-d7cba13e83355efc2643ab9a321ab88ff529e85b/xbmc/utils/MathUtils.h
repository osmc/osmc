   This routine does fast rounding to the nearest integer.
   In the case (k + 0.5 for any integer k) we round up to k+1, and in all other
   instances we should return the nearest integer.
   Thus, { -1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5 } is rounded to { -1, 0, 1, 2 }.
   It preserves the property that round(k) - round(k-1) = 1 for all doubles k.

    /* This implementation warrants some further explanation.
     *
     * First, a couple of notes on rounding:
     * 1) C casts from float/double to integer round towards zero.
     * 2) Float/double additions are rounded according to the normal rules,
     *    in other words: on some architectures, it's fixed at compile-time,
     *    and on others it can be set using fesetround()). The following
     *    analysis assumes round-to-nearest with ties rounding to even. This
     *    is a fairly sensible choice, and is the default with ARM VFP.
     *
     * What this function wants is round-to-nearest with ties rounding to
     * +infinity. This isn't an IEEE rounding mode, even if we could guarantee
     * that all architectures supported fesetround(), which they don't. Instead,
     * this adds an offset of 2147483648.5 (= 0x80000000.8p0), then casts to
     * an unsigned int (crucially, all possible inputs are now in a range where
     * round to zero acts the same as round to -infinity) and then subtracts
     * 0x80000000 in the integer domain. The 0.5 component of the offset
     * converts what is effectively a round down into a round to nearest, with
     * ties rounding up, as desired.
     *
     * There is a catch, that because there is a double rounding, there is a
     * small region where the input falls just *below* a tie, where the addition
     * of the offset causes a round *up* to an exact integer, due to the finite
     * level of precision available in floating point. You need to be aware of
     * this when calling this function, although at present it is not believed
     * that XBMC ever attempts to round numbers in this window.
     *
     * It is worth proving the size of the affected window. Recall that double
     * precision employs a mantissa of 52 bits.
     * 1) For all inputs -0.5 <= x <= INT_MAX
     *    Once the offset is applied, the most significant binary digit in the
     *    floating-point representation is +2^31.
     *    At this magnitude, the smallest step representable in double precision
     *    is 2^31 / 2^52 = 0.000000476837158203125
     *    So the size of the range which is rounded up due to the addition is
     *    half the size of this step, or 0.0000002384185791015625
     *
     * 2) For all inputs INT_MIN/2 < x < -0.5
     *    Once the offset is applied, the most significant binary digit in the
     *    floating-point representation is +2^30.
     *    At this magnitude, the smallest step representable in double precision
     *    is 2^30 / 2^52 = 0.0000002384185791015625
     *    So the size of the range which is rounded up due to the addition is
     *    half the size of this step, or 0.00000011920928955078125
     *
     * 3) For all inputs INT_MIN <= x <= INT_MIN/2
     *    The representation once the offset is applied has equal or greater
     *    precision than the input, so the addition does not cause rounding.
