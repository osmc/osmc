/**
 * This file contains the pattern for moving "globals" from the BSS Segment to the heap.
 * A note on usage of this pattern for globals replacement:
 *
 * This pattern uses a singleton pattern and some compiler/C preprocessor sugar to allow 
 * "global" variables to be lazy instantiated and initialized and moved from the BSS segment 
 * to the heap (that is, they are instantiated on the heap when they are first used rather 
 * than relying on the startup code to initialize the BSS segment). This eliminates the 
 * problem associated with global variable dependencies across compilation units.
 *
 * Reference counting from the BSS segment is used to destruct these globals at the time the 
 * last compilation unit that knows about it is finalized by the post-main shutdown. The book 
 * keeping is done by smuggling a smart pointer into every file that references a particular 
 * "global class" through the use of a 'static' declaration of an instance of that smart 
 * pointer in the header file of the global class (did you ever think you'd see a file scope 
 * 'static' variable in a header file - on purpose?)
 *
 * There are two different ways to use this pattern when replacing global variables.
 * The selection of which one to use depends on whether or not there is a possiblity
 * that the code in the .cpp file for the global can be executed from a static method
 * somewhere. This may take some explanation.
 *
 * The (at least) two ways to do this:
 *
 * 1) You can use the reference object std::shared_ptr to access the global variable.
 *
 * This would be the preferred means since it is (very slightly) more efficent than
 * the alternative. To use this pattern you replace standard static references to
 * the global with access through the reference. If you use the C preprocessor to
 * do this for you can put the following code in the header file where the global's
 * class is declared:
 *
 * static std::shared_ptr<GlobalVariableClass> g_globalVariableRef(xbmcutil::GlobalsSingleton<GlobalVariableClass>::getInstance());
 * #define g_globalVariable (*(g_globalVariableRef.get()))
 *
 * Note what this does. In every file that includes this header there will be a *static*
 * instance of the std::shared_ptr<GlobalVariableClass> smart pointer. This effectively
 * reference counts the singleton from every compilation unit (ie, object code file that
 * results from a compilation of a .c/.cpp file) that references this global directly.
 *
 * There is a problem with this, however. Keep in mind that the instance of the smart pointer
 * (being in the BSS segment of the compilation unit) is ITSELF an object that depends on
 * the BSS segment initialization in order to be initialized with an instance from the
 * singleton. That means, depending on the code structure, it is possible to get into a
 * circumstance where the above #define could be exercised PRIOR TO the setting of the
 * value of the smart pointer.
 *
 * Some reflection on this should lead you to the conclusion that the only way for this to
 * happen is if access to this global can take place through a static/global method, directly
 * or indirectly (ie, the static/global method can call another method that uses the
 * reference), where that static is called from initialization code exercised prior to
 * the start of 'main.'
 *
 * Because of the "indirectly" in the above statement, this situation can be difficult to
 * determine beforehand.
 *
 * 2) Alternatively, when you KNOW that the global variable can suffer from the above described
 * problem, you can restrict all access to the variable to the singleton by changing
 * the #define to:
 *
 * #define g_globalVariable (*(xbmcutil::Singleton<GlobalVariableClass>::getInstance()))
 *
 * A few things to note about this. First, this separates the reference counting aspect
 * from the access aspect of this solution. The smart pointers are no longer used for
 * access, only for reference counting. Secondly, all access is through the singleton directly
 * so there is no reliance on the state of the BSS segment for the code to operate
 * correctly.
 *
 * This solution is required for g_Windowing because it's accessed (both directly and
 * indirectly) from the static methods of CLog which are called repeatedly from
 * code exercised during the initialization of the BSS segment.
