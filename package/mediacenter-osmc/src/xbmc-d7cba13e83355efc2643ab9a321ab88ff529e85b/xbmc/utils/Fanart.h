/// /brief CFanart is the core of fanart support and contains all fanart data for a specific show
///
/// CFanart stores all data related to all available fanarts for a given TV show and provides
/// functions required to manipulate and access that data.
/// In order to provide an interface between the fanart data and the XBMC database, all data
/// is stored internally it its own form, as well as packed into an XML formatted string
/// stored in the member variable m_xml.
/// Information on multiple fanarts for a given show is stored, but XBMC only cares about the
/// very first fanart stored.  These interfaces provide a means to access the data in that first
/// fanart record, as well as to set which fanart is the first record.  Externally, all XBMC needs
/// to care about is getting and setting that first record.  Everything else is maintained internally
/// by CFanart.  This point is key to using the interface properly.
