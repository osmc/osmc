//
// C++ Interface: CKeyboard
//
// Description: Adds features like international keyboard layout mapping on top of the
// platform specific low level keyboard classes.
// Here it must be done only once. Within the other mentioned classes it would have to be done several times.
//
// Keyboards alyways deliver printable characters, logical keys for functional behaviour, modifiers ... alongside
// Based on the same hardware with the same scancodes (also alongside) but delivered with different labels to customers
// the software must solve the mapping to the real labels. This is done here.
// The mapping must be specified by an xml configuration that should be able to access everything available,
// but this allows for double/redundant or ambiguous mapping definition, e.g.
// ASCII/unicode could be derived from scancodes, virtual keys, modifiers and/or other ASCII/unicode.
