//Android rules:
// - All solibs must be in the form ^lib*.so$
// - All solibs must be in the same dir
// - Arch need not be specified, each arch will get its own lib dir.
//   We only keep @ARCH@ here to retain the same structure as *nix.
// * foo.so will be renamed libfoo.so in the packaging stage
