--- How to build a Kodi Debian package ---

There are two available build methods:
1.) debuild / debhelper
  Requirements: debhelper, devscripts, all Kodi build deps 
      sudo apt-get install debhelper devscripts
      sudo apt-get build-dep kodi (if you have on of our repos/ppas added, else read docs/README.linux or docs/README.ubuntu)

  Result: Debian package for your host distribution and architecture only
  Recommended for local installs

  Example Usage: ./mk-debian-package.sh

2.) pdebuild / pbuilder 
  Requirements: pbuilder, devscripts, proper pbuilder environment
      For a comprehensive example how to setup pbuilder read: 
      https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PbuilderHowto

  Result: Debian package for arbitrary Debian based distributions and architectures.
  Recommended for hosting your own apt repository or (clean room) compile testing for various distributions

  Example Usage:
  RELEASEV=16 \
  DISTS=-"unstable" \
  ARCHS="i386 amd64" \
  BUILDER="pdebuild" \
  PDEBUILD_OPTS="--debbuildopts \"-j4\"" \
  PBUILDER_BASE="/home/$USER/xbmc-packaging/pbuilder" \
  DPUT_TARGET="local" \
  ./mk-debian-package.sh
