# This is a simple example showing how you can send a key press event
# to XBMC in a non-queued fashion to achieve a button pressed down
# event i.e. a key press that repeats.

# The repeat interval is currently hard coded in XBMC but that might
# change in the future.

# NOTE: Read the comments in 'example_button1.py' for a more detailed
# explanation.
