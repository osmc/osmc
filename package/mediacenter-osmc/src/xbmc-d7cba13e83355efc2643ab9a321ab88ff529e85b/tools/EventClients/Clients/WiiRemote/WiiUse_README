To compile the WiiRemote event client:

$ sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev
$ make

NOTE: if you get a permission denied error when make'ing the event client, you may need to use root,
e.g. $ sudo make

make will create an executable called WiiUse_WiiRemote that contains the event client.

WiiUse_WiiRemote must be run from this directory as it uses relative linking to the built wiiuse_v0.12 library.

WiiUse_WiiRemote.h contains the button number mappings for the WiiRemote (prefixed with KEYCODE).
