1. Can I use it?
To use the J2ME client only CLDC 1.0 and MIDP 1.0 is needed.
The client will also need bluetooth and must be able to initialize the connection.

2. Compiling the client
To compile the J2ME Application some libraries are needed:
  *Suns Wireless Toolkit
  *Java
  *Ant
Before it can be compiled the link to Suns Wireless Toolkit are needed and are in build.xml 
under <property name="WTK" value=""> where the value should be the path to the toolkit.
When compiling in ubuntu all that is needed are the following command
# ant
The final jar file will end up in build/release/
For installations on some J2ME devices a jad file is needed and it needs the correct filesize of the JAR. This is not an
automated process and thus open the build/release/XBMCRemote.jad and alter it is requiered. The filesize is in bytes
and reflects that of build/release/XBMCRemote.jar

3. Pre Usage
To use the EventClient you'll need to run the EventClient on a computer by:
# python XBMCJ2ME.py
It depends on Pybluez (http://org.csail.mit.edu/pybluez/) and is available in repository
# sudo apt-get install python-bluetooth
