This is a small python program I made to quickly and easily create dummy TV show episode files for XBMC testing.

Simply place a list of TV show titles, one per line, in shows.txt, and run main.py

NOTE: There isn't a lot of error checking here, so its a tad touchy.  You will want to put the EXACT show title as given on TVDB, and i've only tested this on windows.

This was my first ever python program so if you can improve it feel free :)
