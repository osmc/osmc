KODI WIN32 PREBUILT ADDON DEPENDENCIES
======================================
This directory contains a file or sub-directory for every prebuilt dependency
used by one of the addons being built. There are two different modes supported.
Both include a file named <library-id>.txt which must follow the defined format
  <library-id> <download-url>

If the archive, which the <download-url> points at, contains
 * only the necessary files and in the proper directory structure (i.e. an
   "include" and a "lib" directory) then the file must be put into this
   directory and nothing else is needed.
 * unnecessary files and/or does not follow the defined directory structure
   (i.e. an "include" and a "lib" directory) then the file must be put into a
   sub-directory named <library-id>. Furthermore an additional file called
   "install.txt" must be placed in that sub-directory. install.txt contains a
   line for every path/directory/file with a destination where it must be copied
   to. It must follow the defined format
     <source> <destination> [<copy-destination>]
   where <source> must be an existing file, directory or a path containing
   wildcards, <destination> and the optional <copy-destination> must be existing
   directories.
