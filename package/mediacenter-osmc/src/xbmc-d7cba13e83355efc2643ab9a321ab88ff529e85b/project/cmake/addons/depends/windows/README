KODI WIN32 ADDON DEPENDENCIES
=============================
This directory contains the cmake-based buildsystem for dependencies (currently
only prebuilt) used by one or multiple addons. The buildsystem looks into the
"prebuilt" sub-directory, downloads all the specified dependencies, extracts
them and places them into the "depends" sub-directory.

To trigger the cmake-based buildsystem the following command must be executed
with <path> being the path to this directory (absolute or relative, allowing for
in-source and out-of-source builds).

  cmake <path> [-G <generator>]

cmake supports multiple generators, see
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.8/cmake.html#section_Generators for a list.
For win32 builds one of the "Visual Studio XX" or the "NMake Makefiles"
generators is preferred. For the "NMake Makefiles" generator to work the above
command must be called from an environment prepared for VC++ builds (see
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f2ccy3wt.aspx).
