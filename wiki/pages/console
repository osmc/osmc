<p>
You can get to the console in two ways:
<ul>
	<li>Logging in via SSH using an SSH client on a Windows, Mac or Linux system</li>
	<li>By exiting Kodi</li>
</ul>
The default username is osmc with the password osmc.
</p>
<h2>Exiting Kodi</h2>
<p>

	<li>Navigate to the power icon in Kodi</li>
	<li>Select Exit/Quit</li>
	<li>Wait for the OSMC splash screen to appear 
	<li>Press ESC on your keyboard</li>
	<li>Login to your device using osmc for the username and password.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Logging in via SSH</h2>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Windows users can download an SSH client called PuTTY <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Linux and OS X users should have an SSH client already</li>

</li>
</p>
<p>
	<li>Be sure to substitute your IP address in the command above.</li>
