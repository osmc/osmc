The importance of a good power supply
<p>
It is important that your device receives a stable and sufficient power supply. Not having a good PSU can cause many problems with your Raspberry Pi:
<ul>
<li>A multi-coloured square in the corner of the display. This indicates that your Pi is not getting enough power</li>
<li>Random freezes or glitches</li>
<li>Unexpected network dropouts</li>
<li>Randomly seeing external drives unmount and remount (caused by dips in power)</li>
<li>Repeat remote presses</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, some power supplies advertise that they can output a good amount of current but fail to do so. Most power supplies used are simply mobile phone chargers and are thus never really tested to see if they can perform to their advertised specification as they merely trickle charge phones.
For best results, you should ensure:
<ul>
<li>You do not power your Raspberry Pi from a USB port on a computer or TV. These can only output 500mA at the most.</li>
<li>You do not use a mobile phone charger</li>
<li>You use at least a 2A 5V power supply</li>
</ul>
</p>

The OSMC Shop stocks and sells the <a href="http://shop.osmc.tv">Official Raspberry Pi power supply</a> which is a great way to ensure your device runs with complete reliability.
