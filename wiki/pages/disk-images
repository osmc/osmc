Disk images
<p>
OSMC offers disk images for all platforms with an accompanying MD5 checksum. You can use these to load OSMC on to your device. Our installer allows you to pre-configure networking settings as well as configure partitioning and install to other targets. If you want to take advantage of these features we recommend you use our installer.
