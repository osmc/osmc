SMB (Samba) Shares
<p>
Sometimes you may have difficulties in connecting to these shares. This is usually due to issues with DNS resolution. If possible, use the IP address of the server you are connecting to, rather than the hostname. This will stop OSMC having to resolve the device name to an IP address each time and will be more reliable as well as faster.
