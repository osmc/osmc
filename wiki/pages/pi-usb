USB installations
<p>
OSMC can be installed to a USB on Raspberry Pi. You will still need the SD card attached, as this is used by the device to boot. The main operating system however will be stored and run off of the USB stick or hard drive attached.

<h2>Performance boosts</h2>
<p>
This can provide a performance boost as USB installations can provide faster read and write speeds than the embedded SD controller. Although the Pi has USB 2.0 ports, OSMC recommends using a USB 3.0 drive, as this will ensure you fully saturate the USB 2.0 port and take advantage of its speed. USB 2.0 drives can vary in speed so by using a 3.0 rated one, you are ensuring you will get the best USB 2.0 performance possible.

<h2>How to install to USB</h2>
<p>
When using the OSMC installer, you should select your SD card to image. When powering your device, insert both the USB stick and the SD card. OSMC will then partition and set up the USB stick for use. You should keep the SD card plugged in, as the bootloader is stored on this and you will need it to boot each time.
